# Phone Bridge

The phone bridge starts a local Codex app-server, waits for `/readyz`, and then starts a small HTTP/WebSocket bridge for browser clients on the LAN.

Its main job is to make the phone a remote control for the Codex session on your desktop. The desktop keeps the real Codex app-server local, while phone and desktop browsers can share the same bridge-managed thread.

## Start

```bash
npm ci
npm run phone
```

The command prints one URL per LAN IPv4 address:

```text
http://192.168.11.8:45214/?token=...
```

Open the exact printed URL from a phone or another browser on the same network. Use the phone to send prompts, approve work, inspect artifacts, and then resume the same thread from the desktop browser when you return to the PC.

## Runtime Layout

```text
phone browser
  -> token-protected bridge on 0.0.0.0:45214
  -> Codex app-server on ws://127.0.0.1:45213
```

The bridge shares a thread across multiple browser clients. Add `thread=<thread_id>` to resume a known Codex thread. This is the PC/mobile sync path: both devices are looking at the same bridge-managed Codex conversation instead of creating separate sessions.

For live sync with Codex Desktop itself, connect OCdex to the same headless app-server that Desktop opens through a Remote Connection. The normal local conversation view in Codex Desktop uses a private `stdio` app-server, so there is no public external route for a bridge to inject live UI updates into that local view.

For history sync with the normal Desktop view, OCdex refreshes the app-server history after each completed turn by calling `thread/read` and a scan-backed `thread/list`. This is designed for the Desktop sidebar/history and for reopen/refresh continuity. It is not a live body update path for an already-open normal Desktop thread.

Example using an existing control socket:

```bash
CODEX_APP_SERVER_SOCK=/Users/admin/.codex/app-server-control/app-server-control.sock \
CODEX_WORKDIR=/Users/admin/Prj/demo \
PHONE_TOKEN=demo-test-token \
npm run phone
```

In this mode, OCdex does not start a new app-server. It uses the app-server behind the socket. If Codex Desktop opens the same headless app-server as a Remote Connection, the Desktop remote view and OCdex browser subscribe to the same thread event stream.

## Useful Environment Variables

```bash
PHONE_UI_PORT=45214 npm run phone
CODEX_WORKDIR=/Users/admin/Prj/some-project npm run phone
CODEX_MODEL=gpt-5.4 npm run phone
CODEX_APP_SERVER_SOCK=/Users/admin/.codex/app-server-control/app-server-control.sock npm run phone
CODEX_APP_SERVER_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:45213 npm run phone
CODEX_HISTORY_SYNC=0 npm run phone
PHONE_TOKEN=choose-your-own-token npm run phone
PHONE_NTFY_TOPIC=your-private-topic npm run phone
PHONE_PUSHOVER_TOKEN=app-token PHONE_PUSHOVER_USER=user-key npm run phone
PHONE_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/... npm run phone
PHONE_NOTIFY_TIMEOUT_MS=5000 npm run phone
```

Startup notifications are optional. If `PHONE_NTFY_TOPIC` is set, the bridge posts the ready URLs to that ntfy topic. If `PHONE_PUSHOVER_TOKEN` and `PHONE_PUSHOVER_USER` are set, it sends the same URLs through Pushover. If `PHONE_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is set, it posts them to Discord. `npm run phone` loads local `.env` values before reading these variables. `PHONE_NTFY_SERVER` defaults to `https://ntfy.sh` and must use HTTPS. Notification requests time out after `PHONE_NOTIFY_TIMEOUT_MS`, which defaults to 5000 ms. When a LAN IPv4 URL is available, the message includes the tokenized bridge URL, so use a private/protected topic, account, or channel and keep notification credentials out of Git. If no LAN IPv4 URL is detected, the notification omits provider link fields and tells you to check the host console.

Background thread-list polling suppresses repeated identical errors. A transient app-server restart or token mismatch should not continuously fill the chat log with the same `/api/threads` failure.

## UI Surface

- recent thread list and thread resume
- phone control of the desktop Codex session
- PC/mobile continuity through a shared bridge-managed thread
- model, plugin, config, auth, and automation lookups
- approval and sandbox mode controls for the next turn
- repository artifact preview
- Markdown rendering for chat and artifacts
- browser image attachments passed to Codex as `localImage` inputs
- simple, cyberpunk, and botanical color themes from the settings panel
- LAN sharing for a single bridge-managed thread
